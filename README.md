These are a couple projects I did for CMSC 433 Scripting Languages in my undergraduate career at UMBC. Project 2 is very simple, it allows the user to control a sprite and move it around the screen. Project 3 is a summation of all the work we did in
the class and it is a pokemon game which allows the user to buy pokemon from a shop, battle trainers with them to earn more money and buy more pokemon and so on. This project taught me a lot about the use of databases and how they interact with 
applications. This was one of the biggest projects I had ever done and was worthwhile. The project is written in html, css, javascript, and php.
